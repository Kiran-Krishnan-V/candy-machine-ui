*Candy Machine User Interface Setup Guide*

*Introduction:*
This guide offers a detailed walkthrough for configuring the user interface (UI) of your Candy Machine. The UI facilitates NFT minting using the SPL token you've generated, with users utilizing their Phantom wallets for the minting process.

*Prerequisites:*
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A configured Candy Machine with specific details in its config.json file.
- A designated Phantom wallet for minting.
- A newly created SPL token.

*Steps:*

1. *SPL Token Setup:*
If not completed already, create the SPL token following Lesson Three guidelines and note down the SPL token's address.

2. *Update Candy Machine Config:*
Edit the Candy Machine's config.json file, updating the following fields:
   - splTokenAccount: Replace with the address of the created SPL token account.
   - splToken: Replace with the SPL token address.

3. *UI Configuration:*
Refer to the "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" tutorial for creating a UI for your Candy Machine. This UI enables users to connect their Phantom wallets and mint NFTs using the SPL token for payment.

4. *Adjust Minting Logic:*
Within your SPL project's minting logic (as per Lesson Three), modify it to mint NFTs to the Phantom wallet address or adapt the transfer function to deliver minted NFTs to your Phantom wallet.

5. *Testing:*
Thoroughly test the setup by transferring or minting your SPL token to a Phantom account. Utilize the UI to mint NFTs, ensuring a seamless process for users paying in the designated SPL token.
